 <p> Munshiganj, formerly known as Bikrampur, is a historically significant region of Bangladesh. It was once the capital of the Sena Dynasty and a center of Hindu-Buddhist learning, with scholars like Atish Dipankar born here. During the Mughal period, Islamic culture spread across the area.
Under British rule, the region was renamed Munshiganj and became known for zamindars and its role in political awareness. In the 1971 Liberation War, many locals fought bravely, and several memorials stand in their honor.
In 1984, Munshiganj became a separate district. Today, it is known for its rich heritage, Padma River, and famous hilsa fish.</p>
